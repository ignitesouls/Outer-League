# Outer-League

The Outer Gods are now ready to begin intervening within the Lands Between due to the Outer Will's Absence. These Outer Gods will be offering Cosmic Embers to followers who are able to complete their quests. 

This is a No Hit League prioritizing creativity within a set objective to collect as many of these Cosmic Embers from the Outer Gods. 

Set in a separate Timeline Before the Nightmare, Oedon is looking to make their Ascension and needs followers to carry out their will.
